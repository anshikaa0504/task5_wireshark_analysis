# Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## Overview
This repository contains the deliverables for the Cyber Security Internship Task 5. The objective of the task was to capture live network traffic using Wireshark, identify protocols, and analyze basic packet types.

## Files Included
1. **Report.pdf** – A detailed report summarizing the packet capture, filters used, protocols identified, and observations.  
2. **capture_sanitized_anon.pcapng** – The sanitized packet capture file used for analysis, with all sensitive information (IP addresses, MAC addresses, and payloads) anonymized.

## Tools Used
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) – For capturing and analyzing network traffic.
- [TraceWrangler](https://www.tracewrangler.com/) – For anonymizing sensitive information in the pcapng file.

## Task Objective
- Capture live network packets on the host machine.
- Identify at least three different protocols (e.g., ICMP, TCP, TLS, UDP) in the capture.
- Apply filters to view specific types of traffic.
- Sanitize sensitive information before submission.

## Instructions to View
1. Download the repository as a ZIP or clone it.
2. Open `capture_sanitized_anon.pcapng` in Wireshark to explore the network traffic.
3. Read the `Report.pdf` for the summary, analysis, and observations.

## Notes
- All sensitive information (IP addresses, MAC addresses, and payloads) has been anonymized in the `.pcapng` file.
- Screenshots and detailed observations are included in the report PDF.
